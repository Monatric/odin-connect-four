# Connect Four: TDD Edition

A command-line interface game in which players take turns by dropping a colored token into a six-row, seven-column grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space in the column. The objective is until one player hits a straight four of one's colored tokens horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The catch is, unlike the previous projects, I will build this game with the test-driven development philosophy using a popular Ruby testing framework, RSpec.
